# Ubuntu 22.04 images

Runners created from these images preinstall all dependencies (including those specified in the main repo, like mach bootstrap deps), preload the main repo, and prebuild Servo in the release profile.

These are **libvirt/KVM**-based images, compatible with Linux amd64 servers only:

- `servo-ubuntu2204` (ci0, ci1, and ci2 only)
- `servo-ubuntu2204-bench` (ci3 and ci4 only)
